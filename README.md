# TVC-Breakout
This repository contains breakout board PCB plans for the Videoton TVC computer. There are two type of TVC sockets I plan to provide help in this repo : 
- cartridge socket: This is the programmodule connector on the left side of the computer (cartridges uses this socket).
- expansion socket: There are 4 sockets on the top of the computer for IO board expansions (floppy and serial expansion cards use these connectors)

These PCBs is aiming to help new card builders to get easily all the signals from each of the connector.
